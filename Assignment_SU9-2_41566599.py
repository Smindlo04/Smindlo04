#information about feeding the fish
print('''\n Did you know?
           Feed your fish twice a day.
           DO NOT overfeed, as this may :
           1. cause indigestion, and
           2. contaminate your fish tank.
           A good rule of thumb is to only feed
           an amount that the fish can consume
           in less than two minutes.
